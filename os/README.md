# Operating System Configuration Scripts

These scripts install and/or configure package managers and install software
that I use on that operating system.

## Linux

Linux configuration and install scripts are separated by distro.

## Windows

Windows installers are broken up into groups with common scripts between
versions and Windows version specific scripts.
